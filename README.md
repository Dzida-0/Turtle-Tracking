# Turtle-Tracking

## Project idea 
Python based project for tracking turtles with gps. Project is hosted using aws. It has interface , database, tracking 
algorithms and neural network. 

## Data gathering
- Turtles data will be downloaded from web and saved to reuse internet usage. 
- Weather data such as water temperature or waves will be downloaded and saved to reuse internet usage.
All data will be saved to SQL database.
- data will be updated every 24h.

## Features 
- Project will show data as plots, interactive maps or data sets. 
- Project will show turtles starting position, current position and path of their journey.
- Project will mark possible nesting spots and calculate time spend in those spots.
- Project will find possible path between 2 points so that it doesn't intersect land.
- Project will group turtles based on their realise point, size, weight, species, ect.
- Project will show statistic of how each group, turtle is doing compared to rest.
- Project will predict turtles next moves using nural network.
- Project will present how weather affect turtles movement.
- Project will find patterns in turtles movement.
- Project will be displaying data about chosen turtle.

## Technical data
- Project will be using git hub
- project will be using cl/cd
- Project will be using aws

## Expending ideas 
- Ships movement impact


## Steps
### 1. Data downloading, saving, loading
- Downloading all necessary data from internet
- Saving and updating turtles data
- loading given data 
- parsing and storing data in efficient way
### 2. Presenting and processing basic data
- Presenting starting points
- Presenting current points
- Presenting paths
- fixing paths with land map
### 3. Hosting project on AWS
- creating user interface 
- migrating project to claud
### 4. Grouping data
- grouping data by different metrix 
- displaying differences in those metrix 
### 5. Presenting turtle
- Pages dedicated to single turtle
- Pages dedicated to species
