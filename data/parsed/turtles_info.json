With the help of my geeky gang at Sea Turtle Conservancy, we will give everyone a lesson on the dangers of invasive species. Invasive species include animals such as raccoons, coyotes, or even dogs. While we cannot rid beaches of all invasive species, we can take some precautions to limit the impact they can have on sea turtles. Invasive species can decimate a population of sea turtles by digging up and eating their eggs or killing adult turtles. It's important that we follow specific and helpful guidelines to help stop invasive species such as: limiting the amount of trash and food left on the beach, supporting spay and neuter programs along the coast and always keeping an eye on your family pet while at the beach. Conclusively, by educating ourselves and patrolling nesting beaches, we can stop these outrageous attacks on sea turtles. It gives me great pleasure to participate in this year's Tour de Turtles, and although my speed may not break any sound barriers, wish me luck as I set off on this long migration!

After me and my fellow turtle amigos lay our eggs on the beach, we return to the sea. Poachers often disturb these nests and steal our eggs to sell for profit or even to cook and eat. This has vastly affected the turtle population, especially for endangered green sea turtles like myself. To help solve this problem, we all have to work together to raise awareness about the issue.

For the love of STC's annual Tour De Turtle's event, I'm mustering up all the confidence I have to be out here with you all and begin my migration. This year, the cause I am racing for is illegal shell trade. Oh gosh, that sounds scary doesn't it? Illegal shell trade is common within the hawksbill family because our shells are highly sought after for their beautiful pattern, which has caused us to become critically endangered. In the past 100 years, the hawksbill population has decreased by 90 percent and this is because our shells are marketable for things like jewelry and other luxurious items. I cannot imagine a life without my cozy, gold and brown shell. I believe it's crucial that we fight against this trade because it vastly affects the number of hawksbill and other turtles in our world. Along with my support from you and my sponsors at Four Season Nevis, we can educate others on the dangers of shell trade. By collaborating with conservation groups and government agencies, we can gain more trade control and place a stricter emphasis on international and regional trade agreements. This education and awareness will hopefully diminish shell trade for good. Now don't make me blush or anything, but cheer me on as I migrate for the cause of illegal shell trade! <br />", "description": "Coco is an adult hawksbill sea turtle released on July 20, 2014 with a satellite transmitter after nesting on the beach at Jones Bay, Nevis.

Along with my friends at the Four Seasons,&nbsp; I decided to participate in the race to help inform everyone about climate change. Climate change can cause ice caps to melt which results in rising sea levels. These rising sea levels result in the disappearance of many beaches that sea turtles need to travel back to in order to nest. Additionally, climate change can cause rising temperatures, which affects the temperature of sand on the beach. A hatchling's gender is determined by sand temperature-- Eggs in cooler parts of the nest will be males where as eggs in the upper warmer part are females. Scientists predict that the rising temperatures may cause more females to hatch, which directly affects the genetic diversity of turtles. To battle this problem, humans can use energy-saving methods of transportation, recycle more, plant vegetation along beaches to provide better nesting habitat, and look for alternative sources of energy, like solar or wind. You all seem like lovely people, so I would really appreciate if you would follow my Tour de Turtles journey and help raise awareness about the threat of climate change.

It's been so nice to be out here, spending a little time away from the sargassum. I've also been working really hard to prepare for the race this year in order to raise awareness about light pollution. Light pollution is among the many problems my turtle friends and I have been dealing with for quite some time now. Bright beachfront lighting from buildings and streetlights can draw hatchlings inland and away from the ocean, which is very dangerous for them. It can also deter nesting turtles like me. This is some scary stuff so we've got to work together to find safer solutions to light. Some ways to solve these problems can be turning off unnecessary lights visible on nesting beaches or using sea turtle-friendly fixtures that shield the light from the beach! Along with these tips and keeping up with my migration, you can help root me on in the Tour de Turtle's race. </p>", "description": "Anna is an adult female loggerhead sea turtle released with a satellite transmitter on July 26, 2014 from south of the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, Florida.

I believe I will conquer this race the way I do everything else, fair and square. With that being said, I am here at Tour De Turtles to raise awareness about the troubling amount of plastic debris in our oceans. Who better to take on this task? To address such issues, you all must know what makes plastic debris so threatening to our waters. Items like plastic water bottles, bags, and balloons can easily make their way into the ocean. The items have toxic materials and can be easily consumed by marine life when broken down into small pieces. The consumption of this plastic debris has caused the deaths of over 100 million marine animals and can also lead to the entanglement of turtles. Solutions to these issues can be purchasing reusable grocery bags, recycling, not releasing balloons, and picking up litter. Most importantly, I am here partaking in this race to raise awareness. This is my vow to swim all the way to the Caribbean in the hopes to educate all on the dangers of plastic debris. So bring on the competition. Whether the waters are dangerous, in low tide or high tide, warm or cold, I will succeed. After all, the cold never bothered me anyway. So let it go, let it go!

Along with my friends at the Four Seasons, I decided to participate in the race to help inform everyone about climate change. Climate change can cause ice caps to melt which results in rising sea levels. These rising sea levels result in the disappearance of many beaches that sea turtles need to travel back to in order to nest. Additionally, climate change can cause rising temperatures, which affects the temperature of sand on the beach. A hatchling's gender is determined by sand temperature-- Eggs in cooler parts of the nest will be males whereas eggs in the upper warmer part are females. Scientists predict that the rising temperatures may cause more females to hatch, which directly affects the genetic diversity of turtles. To battle this problem, humans can use energy-saving methods of transportation, recycle more, plant vegetation along beaches to provide better nesting habitat, and look for alternative sources of energy, like solar or wind. You all seem like lovely people so I would really appreciate if you would follow my Tour de Turtles journey and help raise awareness about the threat of climate change.

My friends in the AMI Turtle Watch group do a great job monitoring and protecting my favorite beaches but they need your help to raise awareness about a serious threat turtles are facing... Beach Erosion. One way to address beach erosion is through beach nourishment. Nourishment consists of pumping, trucking or otherwise depositing sand on a beach to replace what has been lost to erosion. While beach nourishment is often preferable to armoring, it can negatively impact sea turtles if the sand is too compacted for turtles to nest in or if the sand imported is drastically different from native beach sediments, thereby potentially affecting nest-site selection, digging behavior, incubation temperature and the moisture content of nests. Anna Maria Island has undergone a lot of beach renourishment lately so the turtle watch folks are keeping a close eye on turtle nesting and hatching trends.

To battle this problem, humans can use energy-saving methods of transportation, plant vegetation along beaches to provide better nesting habitat, and use more solar or wind energy. You all seem like great fans so I would really appreciate if you would help me out knock out climate change and follow my Tour de Turtles journey!</span></p>", "description": "Tilly is an adult hawksbill sea turtle released on July 17, 2017with a satellite transmitter.

Throughout my years of traveling the globe, I have seen a lot of amazing things, and some not so amazing things\u2026 commercial trawl fisheries being one of those. Commercial trawl fisheries are big boats that drag giant nets behind them, catching all kinds of creatures. I\u2019ve been lucky that I haven\u2019t gotten stuck in one yet, but it would be very easy for me to get trapped in the net! To make sure other leatherbacks like me don\u2019t get stuck in these nets, make sure you\u2019re eating sustainably sourced fish and supporting companies and countries that use Turtle Excluder Devices on trawl boats.

My sponsors at Anna Maria Island\u2019s Turtle Watch and Bortell\u2019s Lounge nicknamed me Luna, like the moon. I have many fond memories of the moon when I was a hatchling on the beach - it was the beacon that guided my way to the wide and vast ocean I now call home. The Anna Maria Island Turtle Watch worked hard to keep bright white artificial lights off of the beach so I wouldn\u2019t become distracted while trying my best to scurry out to sea. That\u2019s why I decided to nest on my home turf, so I could give my hatchlings a good home and a better chance to survive. Hatchlings born on artificially-lit beaches become attracted to bright white light on beachfront properties. These lights make the beach so bright that hatchlings are not able to tell the difference between the land and ocean, and end up on dangerous roadways and parking lots instead. Adult sea turtles like me know better than to nest in areas impacted by light pollution, and would rather travel far away to find a safe beach for our babies. That\u2019s why Anna Maria Island\u2019s Turtle Watch is partnering with again this year to continue raising awareness about the threat of light pollution. You can make a difference by using sea turtle-friendly lights on the beach, and only lighting what you need for safety.

Each year, foraging and migrating sea turtles like me are accidentally captured, injured or killed by fishermen using longlines to catch tuna, swordfish, sharks and other species. A longline consists of a mainline 40 or more miles long with thousands of additional lines and hooks attached to it.
